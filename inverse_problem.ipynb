    "# The Inverse Problem \n",
    "## a problem set concerning modelling cable temperature with propagation time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy transition forces Alliander to maximize its use of the current power grid. In order to do that insight into cable temperatures is critical, as cable temperature determines the cable carrying capacity. In this problem set we investigate a new method to measure cable temperatures in the field using so-called propagation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors contributing to cable heating**\n",
    "Many factors play a role in determining the temperature of a cable in the field: the current (amperes) the cable is carrying, the soil background temperature (degrees Celsius), the cable type, the cable depth and the thermal properties of the soil surrounding the cable. In practice all these parameters are typically known except the thermal properties of the soil, which requires analysis of field samples to determine. In this problem set the thermal properties of the soil will be treated as unknowns, though you should be aware their influence on cable temperatures is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thermal properties of soil**\n",
    "The way heat dissipates through soil is controlled by two parameters: the thermal resistivity, denoted here with a G, and the thermal capacitity, denoted with a c. The thermal resistivity with units Km/W ranges typically from 0.5 to 1.5, the higher the thermal resistivity the more difficult for heat to dissipate. A higher G-value thus results in a hotter cable, keeping all other variables fixed. The thermal capacity (ranging from 1.5e6 to 2.5e6) is only of influence on dynamic heating of cables, where a low c-value will result in higher peaks in a dynamic temperature profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steady state conditions**\n",
    "In steady state conditions, meaning a stable state of the cable after a very long period of heating up with constant current and soil conditions, the G-value is still important, but the c-value has no influence on **steady state temperatures**. Moreover, in steady state the relation between cable temperature and load is quadratic i.e.\n",
    "$$ T_{cable} \\quad \\approx \\quad \\alpha * I^2$$\n",
    "where the parameter $\\alpha$ depends on the cable type and thermal properties of the soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation between cable temperature and propagation time**\n",
    "\n",
    "The propagation time, denoted with a $p$, is a measured value from a sensor connected to the cable. The sensor measures how long it takes for a signal to travel from one end of the cable to the other end. The relation between cable temperature and this measured value propagation time is approximately linear. For the purposes of this problem set we will assume the relation to be exactly linear i.e. there exist parameters $a_1, a_0$ such that\n",
    "$$ a_1 * p + a_0 = T_{cable}$$\n",
    "for any simultaneous measurement of $p$ and $T_{cable}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Inverse Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem can be summarised as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Given a sufficiently rich dataset of measurements, can the relation between temperature and propagation time be deduced despite certain unknown variables?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer will of course depend on the meanings of 'sufficiently rich dataset', 'deducing the relation' and 'certain unknown variables'. In the problem set below we will provide you with more and more complex problems and ask you to find the relation between propagation time and temperature. We will specify explicitly what the metric of error used is (this is what you should optimize for). The known parameters are always current values, soil temperatures and propagation time measurements. Unknowns are the thermal properties of the soil as well as the cable temperatures.\n"

    "The steady state temperature calculation requires specifying the current load (I), the thermal resistivity (G) and thermal capacity (c) of the soil and the background soil temperature (T_ground). The T_cable value is the cable conductor temperature in degrees Celsius. \n",
